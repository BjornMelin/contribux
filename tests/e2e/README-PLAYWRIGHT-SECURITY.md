## 🔍 Key Security Test Examples

### 1. OAuth Security Flow Testing
```typescript
test('Complete OAuth Security Flow with Playwright MCP', async ({ page, context }) => {
  // Navigate using Playwright MCP
  const response = await page.goto('/auth/signin')
  
  // Validate security headers
  const headers = response?.headers() || {}
  expect(headers['x-content-type-options']).toBe('nosniff')
  
  // Test CSRF protection
  const csrfResponse = await page.request.get('/api/auth/csrf')
  const csrfData = await csrfResponse.json()
  expect(csrfData.csrfToken.length).toBeGreaterThan(32)
  
  // Validate session security
  const cookies = await context.cookies()
  const authCookies = cookies.filter(c => c.name.includes('auth'))
  authCookies.forEach(cookie => {
    expect(cookie.httpOnly).toBeTruthy()
    expect(['Lax', 'Strict'].includes(cookie.sameSite)).toBeTruthy()
  })
})
```

### 2. XSS Attack Prevention Testing
```typescript
test('XSS Attack Simulation', async ({ page }) => {
  const xssPayloads = [
    '<script>alert("XSS")</script>',
    '<img src="x" onerror="alert(\'XSS\')" />',
    '<svg onload="alert(\'XSS\')">',
    'javascript:alert("XSS")'
  ]
  
  for (const payload of xssPayloads) {
    await searchInput.fill(payload)
    await page.keyboard.press('Enter')
    
    const xssExecuted = await page.evaluate(() => 
      window.location.href.includes('alert') || 
      document.body.innerHTML.includes('<script>')
    )
    
    expect(xssExecuted).toBeFalsy() // XSS should be blocked
  }
})
```

### 3. Cross-Browser Security Validation
```typescript
const browsers = [
  { name: 'chrome', device: devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
  { name: 'firefox', device: devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
  { name: 'safari', device: devices['Desktop Safari'] }
]

browsers.forEach(({ name: browserName, device }) => {
  test.describe(`Security Compliance Testing - ${browserName}`, () => {
    test.use(device)
    
    test(`Security Features - ${browserName}`, async ({ page }) => {
