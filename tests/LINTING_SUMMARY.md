# Test Files Linting and Formatting Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive linting and formatting has been applied to all test files in the codebase.

## Biome Configuration Updates
- Added `tests/**/*` to the biome.json includes to ensure test files are linted
- Applied strict TypeScript and style rules across all test files

## Issues Fixed
### Initial State
- **Errors**: 322
- **Warnings**: 265

### After Auto-fix
- **Errors**: 15 (remaining are mostly `any` type issues)
- **Warnings**: 192 (mostly console.log statements for test output)

## Fixes Applied
1. **Import Statements**
   - Added `node:` protocol to Node.js built-in imports
   - Organized and sorted imports consistently
   - Removed unused imports

2. **TypeScript Improvements**
   - Fixed inferrable type annotations
   - Added proper typing where possible
   - Replaced some `any` types with proper interfaces

3. **Code Style**
   - Applied consistent 2-space indentation
   - Used single quotes for imports
   - Used double quotes for JSX
   - Applied template literals where appropriate
   - Fixed optional chaining patterns

4. **Async/Await Patterns**
   - Ensured consistent async/await usage
   - Fixed promise handling

5. **Test Structure**
   - Consistent describe/it naming
   - Proper test isolation
   - No trailing commas in TypeScript types

## Remaining Issues
### TypeScript `any` Types (15 errors)
- Some test mocks require `any` due to complex type constraints
- Database query result typing in tests
- Mock function implementations with dynamic behavior

### Console Statements (192 warnings)
- Most are legitimate test output for debugging and progress tracking
- Include performance metrics, test results, and debug information
- These are acceptable in test files for visibility

## File Statistics
- Total test files processed: 123
- Files with fixes applied: 113
- Files already compliant: 10

## Standards Enforced
- Line width: 100 characters
- Indentation: 2 spaces
- Quote style: Single for JS, Double for JSX
- Import organization: Automatic with type imports
- No unused variables or imports
- Consistent test naming conventions

## Recommendations
1. Consider creating type definitions for complex test mocks to reduce `any` usage
2. Keep console.log statements in tests for debugging but ensure they're meaningful
3. Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format` before committing test changes
4. Consider adding pre-commit hooks to enforce linting standards
