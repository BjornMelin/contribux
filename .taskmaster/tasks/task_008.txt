# Task ID: 8
# Title: Build AI-Powered Opportunity Analyzer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create intelligent system to analyze issues and generate contribution recommendations
# Details:
Implement AI analyzer that evaluates issues for complexity (0-10), impact (0-10), confidence (0-1), and urgency (0-10). Generate implementation hints, identify required skills, estimate time investment, and assess acceptance probability. Create fallback analysis for when AI is unavailable. Store analysis results in database with confidence scores. Implement learning from user feedback to improve accuracy.

# Test Strategy:
Verify AI analysis produces consistent scores, implementation hints are relevant, skill identification is accurate, time estimates are reasonable, and fallback analysis works when AI is unavailable

# Subtasks:
## 1. Scoring Algorithm Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core scoring algorithm that evaluates code quality, efficiency, and correctness with weighted metrics and configurable parameters
### Details:
Implement multi-dimensional scoring system with metrics for code complexity, performance, readability, and best practices. Include configurable weights and thresholds for different evaluation criteria.

## 2. Implementation Hint Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create intelligent hint generation system that provides contextual suggestions and guidance based on code analysis results
### Details:
Build natural language processing component to generate helpful hints, tips, and improvement suggestions based on scoring results and identified patterns in the code.

## 3. Skill Identification System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement machine learning-based system to identify and categorize programming skills demonstrated in submitted code
### Details:
Develop classification algorithms to detect programming concepts, design patterns, data structures usage, and algorithmic approaches. Map identified skills to competency levels.

## 4. Time Estimation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.3
### Description: Build predictive model for estimating completion time and effort required for programming tasks based on complexity analysis
### Details:
Create regression models using historical data, code complexity metrics, and skill levels to predict realistic time estimates for similar tasks and improvements.

## 5. Fallback Analysis Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Implement robust fallback system to handle edge cases, parsing errors, and unsupported code patterns with graceful degradation
### Details:
Design error handling and recovery mechanisms for when primary analysis fails. Include basic static analysis, syntax checking, and simplified scoring as fallback options.

## 6. Learning Feedback Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Develop feedback loop system that learns from user interactions and improves analysis accuracy over time through machine learning
### Details:
Implement reinforcement learning components to collect user feedback, track prediction accuracy, and continuously improve scoring algorithms and hint generation quality.
