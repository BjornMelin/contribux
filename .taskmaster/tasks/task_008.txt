# Task ID: 8
# Title: Build AI-Powered Opportunity Analyzer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create intelligent system using OpenAI Agents SDK v1.0 with GPT-4o-mini-2025-06 to analyze GitHub issues and generate comprehensive contribution recommendations with structured validation and cost tracking
# Details:
Implement advanced AI analyzer using OpenAI Agents SDK v1.0 with GPT-4o-mini-2025-06 that evaluates issues across multiple dimensions: technical complexity (0-10), business impact (0-10), learning potential (0-10), and contribution likelihood (0-1). Generate structured JSON output with comprehensive Zod validation schemas, implementation hints, required skills identification, time investment estimates, and acceptance probability assessments. Include token management and cost tracking for all AI operations. Implement sophisticated guardrails with human-in-the-loop validation, machine learning feedback loops for continuous improvement, and comprehensive fallback mechanisms for AI service failures. Store all analysis results in database with confidence scores and validation metadata.

# Test Strategy:
Verify OpenAI Agents SDK integration works correctly, structured JSON output validates against Zod schemas, multi-dimensional scoring produces consistent and accurate results, token usage and costs are properly tracked, guardrails prevent invalid outputs, human validation workflows function properly, machine learning feedback improves accuracy over time, fallback mechanisms activate during AI failures, and comprehensive integration testing covers both mock responses and live AI analysis quality validation

# Subtasks:
## 1. OpenAI Agents SDK Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate OpenAI Agents SDK v1.0 with GPT-4o-mini-2025-06 for sophisticated issue analysis and recommendation generation
### Details:
Set up OpenAI Agents SDK v1.0 with proper authentication, configure GPT-4o-mini-2025-06 model for issue analysis, implement structured prompting for consistent analysis output, and establish connection management with retry logic.

## 2. Structured JSON Output with Zod Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive Zod validation schemas for all AI analysis results with type-safe structured output
### Details:
Create detailed Zod schemas for analysis results including scoring metrics, implementation hints, skill requirements, time estimates, and confidence levels. Ensure all AI outputs are validated and type-safe before processing.

## 3. Multi-Dimensional Scoring System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Develop advanced scoring algorithm that evaluates technical complexity, business impact, learning potential, and contribution likelihood
### Details:
Implement sophisticated scoring system with four key dimensions: technical complexity (0-10), business impact (0-10), learning potential (0-10), and contribution likelihood (0-1). Include weighted aggregation and confidence scoring for each dimension.

## 4. Token Management and Cost Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive token usage monitoring and cost tracking for all OpenAI API operations
### Details:
Build token counting mechanisms, cost calculation based on current OpenAI pricing, usage analytics dashboard, and budget alerts. Include optimization strategies to minimize token usage while maintaining analysis quality.

## 5. Guardrails and Human-in-the-Loop Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Create sophisticated guardrails system with human validation workflows for AI analysis results
### Details:
Implement content filtering, output validation checks, confidence threshold enforcement, and human review workflows for low-confidence or edge-case analyses. Include escalation mechanisms and approval processes.

## 6. Machine Learning Feedback Loops [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.5
### Description: Develop continuous learning system that improves analysis accuracy through user feedback and outcome tracking
### Details:
Implement feedback collection mechanisms, accuracy tracking metrics, model performance monitoring, and automated retraining pipelines. Include A/B testing framework for prompt optimization and analysis improvement.

## 7. Comprehensive Fallback Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Build robust fallback system for AI service failures with graceful degradation and alternative analysis methods
### Details:
Create multi-tier fallback system including cached analysis results, rule-based scoring algorithms, simplified heuristic analysis, and manual override capabilities. Ensure system remains functional during AI service outages.

## 8. AI Integration Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.4, 8.7
### Description: Develop comprehensive testing suite for AI integration including mock responses and analysis quality validation
### Details:
Build testing framework with mock OpenAI responses, analysis quality metrics validation, performance benchmarking, cost tracking verification, and end-to-end integration tests. Include automated quality assurance for AI outputs.
