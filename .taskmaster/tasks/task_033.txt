# Title: Design Interface Segregation and Role-Based Architecture for GitHub API Client
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 31
# Priority: high
# Description: Redesign the GitHub API client architecture by implementing interface segregation principles and creating smaller, focused interfaces based on CQRS patterns with role-based design and backward compatibility.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive interface segregation for the GitHub API client based on Group 1C architecture research findings: 1) **Interface Analysis and Segregation** - Analyze current large interfaces in the GitHub API client to identify violation of Interface Segregation Principle (ISP). Break down monolithic interfaces into smaller, focused interfaces based on client responsibilities (e.g., IRepositoryReader, IRepositoryWriter, IIssueManager, IWebhookHandler). Create role-based interfaces following single responsibility principle where each interface serves a specific client need. 2) **CQRS Pattern Implementation** - Design command and query interfaces separately (IRepositoryCommands vs IRepositoryQueries). Implement read-only interfaces for data fetching operations and write interfaces for mutation operations. Create specialized interfaces for different data access patterns (streaming, batch, real-time). 3) **Interface Composition Patterns** - Implement composition over inheritance using interface mixins and decorators. Create aggregate interfaces that compose smaller interfaces for complex operations while maintaining loose coupling. Design plugin-style interfaces for extensibility without breaking existing contracts. 4) **Backward Compatibility Strategy** - Implement adapter pattern to maintain compatibility with existing large interfaces. Create facade interfaces that delegate to new segregated interfaces. Use TypeScript's interface merging and conditional types for gradual migration. Implement deprecation warnings and migration guides for smooth transition. 5) **Role-Based Interface Design** - Create interfaces based on user roles (Developer, Maintainer, Contributor, Observer). Implement permission-aware interfaces that expose only relevant methods based on authentication context. Design context-specific interfaces for different use cases (mobile, desktop, CLI, webhook processing).

# Test Strategy:
Verify interface segregation implementation through: 1) **Interface Compliance Testing** - Ensure each new interface follows ISP with focused responsibilities, verify no client is forced to depend on methods it doesn't use, test that interfaces can be implemented independently without unnecessary dependencies. 2) **CQRS Pattern Validation** - Confirm command and query operations are properly separated, verify read-only interfaces cannot perform mutations, test that query interfaces provide optimal data access patterns. 3) **Composition Pattern Testing** - Validate interface composition works correctly without tight coupling, test that aggregate interfaces properly delegate to component interfaces, verify plugin-style extensibility works without breaking existing functionality. 4) **Backward Compatibility Verification** - Test that existing code continues to work with adapter pattern implementation, verify facade interfaces properly delegate to new segregated interfaces, confirm deprecation warnings are displayed appropriately and migration paths are clear. 5) **Role-Based Access Testing** - Validate that role-based interfaces expose only appropriate methods for each user type, test permission-aware interfaces respect authentication context, verify context-specific interfaces work correctly across different platforms and use cases.
