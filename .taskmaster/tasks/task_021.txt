# Title: Create Advanced Filtering and Search
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement sophisticated filtering and search capabilities for opportunity discovery
# Details:
Build advanced filtering system supporting multiple criteria: programming languages, contribution types, complexity ranges, repository characteristics, and time constraints. Implement full-text search using PostgreSQL's pg_trgm extension. Add saved search functionality and search history. Create smart suggestions based on user behavior and preferences.
