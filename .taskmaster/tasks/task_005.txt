# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build Repository Discovery Scanner
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create automated system to discover and analyze GitHub repositories for contribution opportunities using AI-powered analysis and intelligent categorization with OpenAI Agents SDK v1.0
# Details:
Implement production-ready repository scanner that fetches GitHub trending repositories daily focusing on AI/ML topics. Integrate OpenAI Agents SDK v1.0 with GPT-4o-mini-2025-06 for intelligent repository analysis including code quality assessment, documentation evaluation, and community health scoring. Create AI-enhanced repository health scoring algorithm considering stars, forks, recent activity, maintainer responsiveness, PR merge rates, and AI-analyzed quality metrics. Implement structured JSON output with Zod validation schemas for type-safe AI responses. Store repository data with metadata in PostgreSQL. Implement incremental updates to avoid re-processing unchanged repositories. Add support for user-specified repositories to monitor. Include comprehensive token management, cost tracking, guardrails, and performance optimization for production AI usage.

# Test Strategy:
