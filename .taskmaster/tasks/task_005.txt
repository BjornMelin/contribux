# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build Repository Discovery Scanner
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create automated system to discover and analyze GitHub repositories for contribution opportunities
# Details:
Implement repository scanner that fetches GitHub trending repositories daily focusing on AI/ML topics. Create repository health scoring algorithm considering stars, forks, recent activity, maintainer responsiveness, and PR merge rates. Store repository data with metadata in PostgreSQL. Implement incremental updates to avoid re-processing unchanged repositories. Add support for user-specified repositories to monitor.

# Test Strategy:
Verify scanner discovers trending AI/ML repositories, health scores are calculated correctly, data is stored properly in database, incremental updates work, and user-specified repositories are monitored

# Subtasks:
## 1. Trending Repository Fetching [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement API integration to fetch trending repositories from GitHub, GitLab, and other platforms with rate limiting and error handling
### Details:
Set up API clients for multiple Git platforms, implement pagination handling, configure rate limiting mechanisms, add retry logic for failed requests, and create data normalization layer for different API responses

## 2. Health Scoring Algorithm Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop comprehensive repository health scoring system based on multiple metrics and weighted factors
### Details:
Design scoring algorithm considering factors like commit frequency, issue resolution time, documentation quality, test coverage, community engagement, and maintenance activity. Implement configurable weights and thresholds for different scoring criteria

## 3. Data Storage Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Design and implement efficient database schema and caching strategies for repository data storage
### Details:
Create optimized database schema for repository metadata and health scores, implement Redis caching layer, design data partitioning strategies, set up database indexing for fast queries, and implement data compression techniques

## 4. Incremental Update Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Implement smart update mechanism to efficiently refresh repository data without full rescans
### Details:
Design delta update system to track changes since last scan, implement timestamp-based incremental updates, create change detection algorithms, set up background job scheduling, and optimize update frequency based on repository activity

## 5. User-Specified Repository Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Add functionality for users to manually add and track custom repositories beyond trending lists
### Details:
Create user interface for repository URL input, implement repository validation and metadata extraction, add user-specific repository lists, create custom scanning schedules, and implement access control for private repositories

## 6. Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting system for scanner performance and health metrics
### Details:
Set up application performance monitoring, implement API rate limit tracking, create database performance metrics, add scan duration monitoring, implement alerting for failures and bottlenecks, and create performance dashboards with key metrics visualization
