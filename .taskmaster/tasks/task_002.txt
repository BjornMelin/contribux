# Task ID: 2
# Title: Configure Database Schema with Neon PostgreSQL
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Neon PostgreSQL database with complete schema including pgvector extension for AI embeddings
# Details:
Create Neon PostgreSQL 16 database instance. Implement the complete database schema from the PRD including users, repositories, opportunities, user_preferences, notifications, and contribution_outcomes tables. Enable pgvector 0.7, pg_cron 1.6, and pg_trgm extensions. Create all indexes for performance optimization. Set up database migrations using a migration tool compatible with Neon. Configure connection pooling and environment variables for database access.

# Test Strategy:
Run all migrations successfully, verify all tables and indexes are created, test database connection from Next.js app, validate foreign key constraints, and ensure pgvector extension works for similarity searches
