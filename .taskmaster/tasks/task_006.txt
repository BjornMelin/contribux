# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Issue Discovery and Filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Build system to discover and filter GitHub issues suitable for contributions
# Details:
Create issue discovery system that scans repositories for open issues. Filter issues based on labels (good first issue, help wanted, documentation, bug), age, and activity. Exclude issues that are already assigned or have recent activity indicating work in progress. Implement deduplication logic to avoid processing the same issue multiple times. Store issue data with metadata for AI analysis.

# Test Strategy:
Verify issues are discovered from monitored repositories, filtering logic works correctly, duplicates are avoided, issue data is stored properly, and only suitable issues are selected for analysis

# Subtasks:
## 1. Repository Scanning Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement core repository scanning functionality to discover and collect issues from target repositories
### Details:
Develop API integration modules for repository platforms (GitHub, GitLab, etc.), implement pagination handling, rate limiting, and error recovery mechanisms. Create configurable scanning parameters for repository selection and issue retrieval scope.

## 2. Label-based Filtering Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create intelligent filtering system based on issue labels and metadata to identify relevant issues
### Details:
Design label taxonomy and matching algorithms, implement configurable filter rules, create whitelist/blacklist functionality for labels, and develop pattern matching for label combinations and hierarchies.

## 3. Activity Analysis and Exclusion Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop activity-based filtering to exclude stale, inactive, or irrelevant issues based on engagement metrics
### Details:
Implement algorithms to analyze issue activity patterns, comment frequency, last update timestamps, contributor engagement levels, and create configurable thresholds for exclusion based on activity metrics.

## 4. Deduplication System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Build intelligent deduplication engine to identify and merge duplicate or similar issues across repositories
### Details:
Develop similarity detection algorithms using title/description analysis, implement fuzzy matching for cross-repository duplicates, create merge strategies for duplicate issues, and maintain reference tracking for deduplicated items.

## 5. Metadata Storage Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Design and implement optimized storage system for issue metadata with efficient querying and retrieval capabilities
### Details:
Create database schema for issue metadata storage, implement indexing strategies for fast searches, develop data compression techniques for large datasets, and create backup/archival systems for historical issue data.
