# Task ID: 26
# Title: Fix Database Test Failures for 100% Coverage
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Complete the final database test fixes to achieve 100% test coverage. Major infrastructure issues have been resolved with 97/108 tests now passing (89.8% success rate). Focus on resolving the remaining 11 failing tests related to advanced search function compatibility, vector calculation edge cases, and PostgreSQL extension dependencies.
# Details:
Complete the database testing infrastructure by addressing the final 11 failing tests out of 108 total tests. Major achievements include: fixed database schema setup (76 SQL statements + 6 search functions), resolved connection issues with Neon test database, fixed sample data insertion and SQL parsing, corrected monitoring validation schemas with PostgreSQL bigint coercion, fixed vector index expectations for HNSW indexes, updated PostgreSQL v16-17 compatibility, and improved vector distance calculations for halfvec operations. Remaining work focuses on: 1) Resolve advanced search function type compatibility issues by updating function signatures and parameter handling to work across different PostgreSQL versions and configurations. 2) Fix minor vector calculation edge cases in halfvec operations by improving precision handling and boundary condition testing. 3) Implement graceful handling for monitoring features that depend on unavailable PostgreSQL extensions by adding conditional checks and alternative metrics collection methods. The database infrastructure is now production-ready with comprehensive schema validation, vector search capabilities, and monitoring tools.

# Test Strategy:
Run the complete test suite to verify progression from current 97/108 passing tests to 100% success rate. Focus testing on the remaining 11 failing tests: validate advanced search function compatibility across PostgreSQL versions, test vector calculation edge cases with various data types and precision requirements, and verify monitoring features gracefully handle missing extensions. Confirm all database infrastructure components (schema setup, connections, sample data, monitoring, vector operations) continue to work correctly while resolving the final issues. Validate that fixes maintain the production-ready status of core functionality while achieving complete test coverage.
