# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Create complete testing suite including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using Vitest
# Details:
Set up Vitest for unit testing with >80% code coverage. Create integration tests for API endpoints and database operations. Implement E2E tests using Playwright for critical user workflows. Add component testing for React components. Create performance tests for API response times. Set up automated testing in CI/CD pipeline.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all tests pass consistently, code coverage meets targets, E2E tests cover critical workflows, component tests validate UI behavior, and performance tests ensure response time targets

# Subtasks:

### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Vitest testing framework for unit testing including setup files, test utilities, and basic test structure
### Details:
Install and configure Vitest, create test setup files, configure test environment, establish testing utilities and helpers, create sample unit tests for core functions

## 2. Integration Test Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Develop integration tests to verify component interactions and API integrations work correctly together
### Details:
Create integration test suites for API endpoints, database interactions, service layer integration, mock external dependencies, test data flow between components

## 3. E2E Test Creation with Playwright [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Set up Playwright for end-to-end testing and create comprehensive user journey tests
### Details:
Install and configure Playwright, create page object models, implement user flow tests, set up test data management, configure browser testing environments

## 4. Component Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Implement component-level tests to verify UI components render and behave correctly in isolation
### Details:

### Description: Implement performance testing to measure and validate application speed, load handling, and resource usage
### Details:
Set up performance testing tools, create load testing scenarios, implement performance benchmarks, test API response times, monitor memory usage and optimization

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.2, 24.3, 24.4, 24.5
### Description: Integrate all testing suites into CI/CD pipeline for automated testing on code changes and deployments
### Details:
Configure GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD tool, set up automated test execution, implement test reporting, configure test coverage requirements, set up deployment gates based on test results
