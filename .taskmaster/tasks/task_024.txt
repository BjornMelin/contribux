# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Create complete modern testing suite including unit, integration, end-to-end, component, performance, AI, accessibility, and visual regression tests using Vitest and Playwright with comprehensive CI/CD integration
# Details:
Set up Vitest for unit testing with >80% code coverage and modern features. Create integration tests for API endpoints and database operations. Implement E2E tests using Playwright for critical user workflows with advanced capabilities. Add component testing with React Testing Library. Create performance tests with Core Web Vitals monitoring. Implement specialized AI component testing with mock responses. Add automated accessibility testing with axe-core. Set up visual regression testing with screenshot comparison. Build robust CI/CD pipeline with parallel testing and deployment gates.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all tests pass consistently across all testing types, code coverage meets targets, E2E tests cover critical workflows with modern Playwright features, component tests validate UI behavior with React Testing Library, performance tests monitor Core Web Vitals, AI component tests validate model responses, accessibility tests ensure WCAG compliance, visual regression tests catch UI changes, and CI/CD pipeline ensures quality gates
