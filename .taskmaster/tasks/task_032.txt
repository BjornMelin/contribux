# Title: Create Usage Examples and Cookbook for GitHub API Client
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: low
# Description: Create comprehensive usage examples, cookbook, and developer documentation for the GitHub API client with practical code examples, best practices, error handling patterns, and performance optimization guides.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive developer documentation and cookbook for the GitHub API client including: 1) **Practical Code Examples** - Create real-world usage examples for common scenarios like repository discovery, issue analysis, PR management, and webhook handling. Include complete TypeScript examples with proper error handling, authentication setup, and rate limiting usage. Document GraphQL query optimization techniques with point calculation examples and cursor-based pagination patterns. 2) **Best Practices Guide** - Document authentication best practices including GitHub Apps vs personal tokens, token rotation strategies, and security considerations. Create guidelines for efficient API usage including batching requests, using DataLoader pattern, and implementing proper caching strategies. Include performance optimization patterns like query aliasing and conditional requests with ETags. 3) **Error Handling Patterns** - Document comprehensive error handling strategies for rate limiting, network failures, authentication errors, and API deprecations. Provide retry logic examples with exponential backoff and jitter. Include circuit breaker pattern implementation for resilient API interactions. 4) **Advanced Features Documentation** - Create detailed guides for GraphQL optimization including query complexity analysis, point-aware querying, and fragment usage. Document caching strategies with Redis integration, ETag handling, and cache invalidation patterns. Include webhook signature validation examples and real-time event processing. 5) **Troubleshooting Guides** - Create diagnostic guides for common issues like rate limit exceeded, authentication failures, and webhook delivery problems. Include debugging techniques, logging best practices, and monitoring setup. Provide performance profiling guides and bottleneck identification strategies. 6) **Performance Tuning Tips** - Document optimization techniques for high-volume applications including connection pooling, request batching, and intelligent caching. Include memory optimization strategies and garbage collection considerations. Provide load testing examples and performance benchmarking guides.

# Test Strategy:
Verify documentation quality and completeness through: 1) **Code Example Validation** - Execute all provided code examples to ensure they work correctly, verify TypeScript compilation passes for all examples, test authentication flows with both GitHub Apps and personal tokens, and validate GraphQL queries stay within point limits. 2) **Best Practices Verification** - Review error handling patterns work correctly under failure conditions, test retry logic with exponential backoff functions properly, verify caching strategies improve performance measurably, and confirm security practices follow GitHub's recommendations. 3) **Documentation Completeness** - Ensure all major API client features are covered with examples, verify troubleshooting guides address common developer pain points, confirm performance tuning tips provide measurable improvements, and validate advanced features like GraphQL optimization are thoroughly documented. 4) **Developer Experience Testing** - Have developers follow cookbook examples to complete real tasks, measure time-to-first-success for new developers, gather feedback on documentation clarity and usefulness, and verify examples work in different development environments. 5) **Integration Testing** - Test cookbook examples against real GitHub API endpoints, verify webhook examples work with actual GitHub webhook deliveries, validate performance optimization examples show measurable improvements, and confirm troubleshooting guides resolve actual issues.
