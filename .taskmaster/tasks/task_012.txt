# Title: Build Real-time Dashboard with SWR v3
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a modern Progressive Web App dashboard with real-time opportunities feed, advanced AI-powered filtering, and comprehensive accessibility features using Next.js 15 and React Server Components
# Details:
Build a cutting-edge dashboard using Next.js 15 App Router with React Server Components for optimized server-side rendering. Implement SWR v3 with native TanStack Query integration for enhanced data fetching and caching. Add Progressive Web App features with service workers for offline support. Use Server-Sent Events for real-time updates. Create sophisticated opportunity cards with AI analysis, scores, and interactive elements. Implement AI-powered semantic search and advanced filtering. Add virtual scrolling and lazy loading for performance optimization. Use modern CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design. Ensure comprehensive accessibility following WCAG 2.2 guidelines.

# Test Strategy:
Verify PWA installation works, offline functionality operates correctly, real-time updates via SSE function properly, AI-powered search returns relevant results, virtual scrolling performs efficiently with large datasets, accessibility features meet WCAG 2.2 standards, and responsive design works across all modern devices and browsers
