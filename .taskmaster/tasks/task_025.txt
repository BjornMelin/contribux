# Task ID: 25
# Title: Prepare Production Deployment and Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18, 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement modern production deployment with Vercel, comprehensive automation, security hardening, and open source preparation using industry best practices from 2025
# Details:
Deploy to Vercel with edge functions and performance optimization. Implement Infrastructure as Code with Terraform/CDK for reproducible deployments. Set up advanced GitHub Actions workflows with automated testing, security scanning, and deployment automation. Create comprehensive documentation with interactive examples and API docs. Implement production monitoring, alerting, and observability. Establish disaster recovery procedures with automated backups. Prepare for open source release with community guidelines, governance structure, and security review.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Vercel deployment with edge functions works correctly, GitHub Actions workflows execute successfully, infrastructure provisioning is reproducible, security scans pass, monitoring and alerts function properly, backup/recovery procedures work, and documentation is complete with interactive examples

Set up application performance monitoring (APM), implement structured logging and log aggregation, configure uptime monitoring and health checks, create performance dashboards, set up alerting for critical metrics, implement error tracking and reporting, and establish SLA monitoring.

## 6. Disaster Recovery and Backup Systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.2
### Description: Establish comprehensive backup strategies and disaster recovery procedures to ensure business continuity and data protection.
### Details:
Implement automated database backups with point-in-time recovery, set up cross-region backup replication, create disaster recovery runbooks, implement backup testing and validation procedures, establish RTO/RPO targets, create data restoration procedures, and set up backup monitoring and alerting.

## 7. Modern Documentation with Interactive Examples [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive, modern documentation including interactive API documentation, deployment guides, and user manuals with examples.
### Details:
Set up documentation site with modern framework (Docusaurus, GitBook, or similar), create interactive API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger, write comprehensive deployment and setup guides, create user tutorials with code examples, implement documentation search, set up automated documentation updates, and create contribution guidelines.

## 8. Open Source Community Preparation [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.7
