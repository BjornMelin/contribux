# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Opportunity Claiming and Tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an advanced AI-powered system for users to claim opportunities and track contribution progress with real-time monitoring, intelligent analytics, and enhanced user experience features
# Details:
Build a comprehensive opportunity claiming system with GitHub webhook v4 API integration, real-time progress tracking via Server-Sent Events, AI-powered progress analysis and abandonment detection, sophisticated conflict resolution, gamification elements, and integration with external development tools.
