# Task ID: 14
# Title: Create tRPC v11 API Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement enterprise-grade type-safe API layer using tRPC v11 with advanced features including native QueryOptions, comprehensive Zod validation, Vercel Edge Middleware integration, real-time subscriptions, and OpenAPI documentation generation for all client-server communication
# Details:
Set up tRPC v11 with Next.js App Router integration leveraging native QueryOptions and enhanced TypeScript support. Create comprehensive routers for opportunities, repositories, users, and preferences with advanced input/output validation using Zod schemas. Implement sophisticated authentication middleware supporting multiple auth methods. Build enterprise-grade error handling with structured logging and monitoring. Integrate Vercel Edge Middleware for high-performance rate limiting. Add performance optimizations including connection pooling, caching, and query optimization. Generate OpenAPI documentation for external integrations. Implement real-time capabilities with WebSocket subscriptions for live updates.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all API endpoints work correctly with comprehensive type safety, authentication middleware protects routes with multiple auth methods, advanced error handling and logging function properly, Vercel Edge Middleware rate limiting performs optimally, real-time subscriptions work reliably, OpenAPI documentation generates accurately, and performance optimizations deliver measurable improvements
