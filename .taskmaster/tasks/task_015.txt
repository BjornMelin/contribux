# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Background Job Processing with QStash
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up enterprise-grade background job processing for repository scanning and AI analysis using QStash v3 with advanced features including flow control, DLQ handling, job dependencies, and comprehensive monitoring
# Details:
Integrate Upstash QStash v3 for robust background job processing with modern enterprise features. Create sophisticated job workflows for repository scanning, issue discovery, AI analysis, and notification sending. Implement advanced scheduling with cron expressions and dynamic triggers. Build intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and circuit breakers. Add comprehensive monitoring, metrics collection, and cost optimization. Implement job dependency management, workflow orchestration, and automatic error recovery. Ensure jobs are idempotent, performant, and cost-effective at scale.

# Test Strategy:
Verify advanced job scheduling works with cron expressions, retry logic includes circuit breakers, dependency management handles complex workflows, monitoring provides comprehensive visibility, cost optimization reduces operational expenses, and system handles enterprise-scale job volumes with reliability
