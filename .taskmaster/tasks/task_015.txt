# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Background Job Processing with QStash
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up reliable background job processing for repository scanning and AI analysis
# Details:
Integrate Upstash QStash v3 for background job processing. Create jobs for repository scanning, issue discovery, AI analysis, and notification sending. Implement job scheduling with cron-like syntax. Add job retry logic with exponential backoff. Create job monitoring and failure alerting. Ensure jobs are idempotent and can handle failures gracefully.

# Test Strategy:
Verify jobs execute on schedule, retry logic works for failures, job monitoring provides visibility, and system handles high job volumes without issues

# Subtasks:
## 1. QStash Integration Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up QStash service integration including authentication, connection configuration, and basic client initialization for job queue management.
### Details:
Configure QStash API credentials, establish secure connection, implement client wrapper with proper error handling, and create configuration management for QStash endpoints and settings.

## 2. Job Creation and Scheduling [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Implement job creation mechanisms and scheduling functionality to queue and manage job execution timing.
### Details:
Create job definition structures, implement job serialization/deserialization, build scheduling interface for immediate and delayed execution, and establish job priority and categorization systems.

## 3. Retry Logic Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Develop comprehensive retry mechanisms for failed jobs including exponential backoff, maximum retry limits, and dead letter queue handling.
### Details:
Implement configurable retry policies, exponential backoff algorithms, failure classification logic, dead letter queue management, and retry attempt tracking with detailed logging.

## 4. Idempotency Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Implement idempotency mechanisms to ensure jobs can be safely retried without causing duplicate operations or side effects.
### Details:
Design idempotency key generation, implement duplicate detection logic, create idempotency storage layer, and establish cleanup mechanisms for expired idempotency records.

## 5. Monitoring and Alerting [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3, 15.4
### Description: Set up comprehensive monitoring, metrics collection, and alerting systems for job processing health and performance tracking.
### Details:
Implement job execution metrics, queue depth monitoring, failure rate tracking, performance dashboards, alert configuration for critical failures, and integration with monitoring platforms.
