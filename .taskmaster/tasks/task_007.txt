# Task ID: 7
# Title: Integrate OpenAI Agents SDK for Issue Analysis
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up OpenAI Agents SDK v1.0 for intelligent analysis of contribution opportunities
# Details:
Install and configure OpenAI Agents SDK v1.0 with GPT-4o-mini-2025-06 model. Create specialized agents: ContribuxAnalyzer for issue complexity analysis, ContribuxStrategist for implementation suggestions. Implement cost tracking and token limits. Add error handling and fallback mechanisms. Configure guardrails and timeout settings. Create structured JSON output schemas using Zod validation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify OpenAI API integration works, agents produce structured JSON output, cost tracking functions correctly, error handling works for API failures, and token limits are respected

# Subtasks:
## 1. SDK Setup and Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure the OpenAI SDK with proper authentication, environment variables, and connection settings
### Details:
Set up OpenAI Python SDK, configure API keys securely using environment variables, establish connection parameters, set up proper timeout and retry configurations, and create base client initialization with proper error handling for authentication failures

## 2. Specialized Agent Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Design and implement specialized AI agents with custom prompts, model selection, and parameter tuning for specific use cases
### Details:
Create agent classes with role-specific system prompts, implement model selection logic (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo), configure temperature and token limits, design conversation context management, and implement agent specialization for different domains or tasks

## 3. Cost Tracking Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive cost monitoring and tracking system for OpenAI API usage
### Details:
Create token counting mechanisms, implement cost calculation based on model pricing, set up usage logging and monitoring, create budget alerts and limits, implement cost reporting dashboards, and add per-user or per-session cost tracking

## 4. Error Handling and Fallbacks [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Implement robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and fallback strategies for OpenAI API failures
### Details:
Create comprehensive exception handling for API errors, implement exponential backoff retry logic, design fallback mechanisms for rate limits and service outages, add circuit breaker patterns, implement graceful degradation strategies, and create error logging and alerting systems

## 5. Output Schema Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.4
### Description: Implement structured output validation and parsing to ensure consistent and reliable AI responses
### Details:
Design JSON schema definitions for expected outputs, implement response validation and parsing logic, create output sanitization and formatting functions, add schema enforcement mechanisms, implement fallback parsing strategies for malformed responses, and create output quality assurance checks
