# Title: Implement Security Measures and Compliance
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive zero-trust security architecture with Web Crypto API encryption, Vercel Edge Middleware for ultra-fast rate limiting, enhanced GDPR compliance, automated security scanning, and continuous compliance monitoring
# Details:
Build modern security infrastructure using Web Crypto API for client-side encryption and secure key management. Implement Vercel Edge Middleware for high-performance rate limiting and security controls. Configure advanced CORS and CSP with fine-grained controls. Create sophisticated webhook verification with replay attack prevention. Implement GDPR Compliance 2.0 with data portability and privacy-by-design. Establish zero-trust architecture with continuous verification, automated security scanning, vulnerability detection, and comprehensive compliance monitoring with audit trails.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Web Crypto API encryption/decryption works correctly, Vercel Edge Middleware rate limiting performs optimally, advanced CORS/CSP configurations prevent attacks, webhook signatures are validated with replay protection, GDPR 2.0 features function properly with privacy-by-design, zero-trust verification works continuously, automated security scanning detects vulnerabilities, and compliance monitoring generates accurate audit trails and reports

# Subtasks:
## 1. Web Crypto API Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement Web Crypto API for client-side encryption, secure key management, and cryptographic operations with zero-trust principles

Set up Web Crypto API for client-side encryption/decryption, implement secure key generation and storage using SubtleCrypto, create key derivation functions, establish secure key exchange protocols, implement digital signatures for data integrity, and add cryptographic random number generation for security tokens
<info added on 2025-06-24T03:55:39.606Z>
Successfully completed comprehensive Web Crypto API implementation with crypto.ts module (614 lines) featuring ECDSA key generation, HMAC operations, PBKDF2 key derivation, secure token generation, data hashing, and device fingerprinting. Implemented zero-trust.ts (640 lines) with continuous verification, device trust scoring, behavioral analysis, and micro-segmentation capabilities. Deployed edge-middleware.ts (746 lines) providing ultra-fast edge security including rate limiting, DDoS protection, and threat intelligence integration. Added webhook-verification.ts (746 lines) with HMAC verification, replay attack prevention, and exponential backoff retry mechanisms. Created csp-cors.ts (649 lines) for dynamic CORS management, nonce-based CSP implementation, violation reporting, and policy versioning. All security implementations follow zero-trust architecture principles and are production-ready for deployment.

WebAuthn simplification completed successfully. Removed all WebAuthn authentication code and dependencies, replacing with GitHub OAuth only using NextAuth.js. Key changes include: removed WebAuthn packages (@simplewebauthn/browser, @simplewebauthn/server, @simplewebauthn/types), implemented NextAuth.js with GitHub OAuth provider, created simplified auth middleware with rate limiting, updated auth types and database schema, removed WebAuthn-specific tables and migration scripts, updated GDPR and OAuth implementations, created comprehensive test suite for simplified auth, and removed WebAuthn test files while updating existing tests. Authentication system is now significantly simpler and more maintainable with single OAuth provider approach.
