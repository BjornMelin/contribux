# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Security Measures and Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Add comprehensive security measures including encryption, rate limiting, and GDPR compliance
# Details:
Implement Web Crypto API for token encryption. Add CORS configuration and CSP headers. Create rate limiting middleware using Vercel Edge Functions. Implement webhook signature verification for GitHub webhooks. Add GDPR compliance features including data export and deletion. Create security audit logging and monitoring.

# Test Strategy:
Verify encryption/decryption works correctly, rate limiting prevents abuse, webhook signatures are validated, GDPR features function properly, and security audit logs are generated

# Subtasks:
## 1. Encryption Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive encryption for data at rest and in transit, including SSL/TLS configuration, database encryption, and secure key management
### Details:
Set up SSL/TLS certificates, configure database encryption, implement secure key storage and rotation, encrypt sensitive data fields, and establish secure communication protocols

## 2. CORS and CSP Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies and Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent cross-site attacks
### Details:
Define allowed origins for CORS, set up CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks, configure trusted domains, implement nonce-based CSP for dynamic content, and test cross-origin requests

## 3. Rate Limiting Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Implement rate limiting middleware to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks with configurable limits per endpoint and user
### Details:
Set up rate limiting rules per API endpoint, implement user-based rate limiting, configure sliding window algorithms, add rate limit headers, and create bypass mechanisms for trusted sources

## 4. Webhook Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Implement secure webhook verification system with signature validation and replay attack prevention
### Details:
Set up webhook signature verification using HMAC, implement timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks, create webhook endpoint authentication, and add webhook payload validation

## 5. GDPR Compliance Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2
### Description: Implement GDPR compliance features including data consent management, right to be forgotten, and data portability
### Details:
Create consent management system, implement data deletion workflows, add data export functionality, set up privacy policy management, and create audit trails for data processing activities

## 6. Security Audit Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2, 19.3, 19.4, 19.5
### Description: Implement comprehensive security audit logging system to track all security-related events and compliance activities
### Details:
