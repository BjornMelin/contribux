# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Security Measures and Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive zero-trust security architecture with Web Crypto API encryption, Vercel Edge Middleware for ultra-fast rate limiting, enhanced GDPR compliance, automated security scanning, and continuous compliance monitoring
# Details:
Build modern security infrastructure using Web Crypto API for client-side encryption and secure key management. Implement Vercel Edge Middleware for high-performance rate limiting and security controls. Configure advanced CORS and CSP with fine-grained controls. Create sophisticated webhook verification with replay attack prevention. Implement GDPR Compliance 2.0 with data portability and privacy-by-design. Establish zero-trust architecture with continuous verification, automated security scanning, vulnerability detection, and comprehensive compliance monitoring with audit trails.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Web Crypto API encryption/decryption works correctly, Vercel Edge Middleware rate limiting performs optimally, advanced CORS/CSP configurations prevent attacks, webhook signatures are validated with replay protection, GDPR 2.0 features function properly with privacy-by-design, zero-trust verification works continuously, automated security scanning detects vulnerabilities, and compliance monitoring generates accurate audit trails and reports
