# Title: Fix Critical TypeScript Compilation Errors Blocking Development Server
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: highest
# Description: CRITICAL PRIORITY: Resolve critical TypeScript compilation errors that prevent the development server from starting, addressing type errors in imports, module resolution, and strict TypeScript configurations to unblock `pnpm dev`. This is blocking all development work and must be resolved immediately before any other development can proceed.
# Details:
**CRITICAL PATH ITEM** - Implement comprehensive TypeScript error resolution to restore development server functionality and unblock all development work: 1) **Import and Module Resolution Fixes** - Audit all import statements for missing type declarations, incorrect relative/absolute paths, and module resolution conflicts. Fix barrel exports and index file imports that may be causing circular dependencies. Update import paths to use proper TypeScript module resolution with baseUrl and paths configuration. Resolve any missing @types packages and ensure all third-party dependencies have proper type definitions. 2) **Strict TypeScript Configuration** - Review and fix tsconfig.json strict mode violations including noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks, and noImplicitReturns. Address any type assertion issues and ensure proper type guards are in place. Fix generic type constraints and conditional type issues that may be causing compilation failures. 3) **Development Server Configuration** - Ensure Next.js TypeScript integration is properly configured with correct typescript and @types/node versions. Fix any webpack or build tool configuration conflicts that affect TypeScript compilation. Address any environment variable typing issues and ensure proper .env.d.ts declarations. 4) **Dependency and Version Conflicts** - Audit package.json for TypeScript version conflicts between dependencies. Ensure all @types packages are compatible with the current TypeScript version. Resolve any peer dependency warnings that might affect compilation. Update or downgrade packages causing type conflicts while maintaining functionality. **NOTE: This task blocks all other development work - prioritize immediate resolution.**

# Test Strategy:
**CRITICAL VERIFICATION** - Verify TypeScript compilation resolution through: 1) **Compilation Verification** - Run `pnpm dev` successfully without TypeScript errors, execute `tsc --noEmit` to verify type checking passes completely, and ensure `pnpm build` completes without compilation errors. 2) **Import Resolution Testing** - Verify all import statements resolve correctly in IDE and command line, test that barrel exports work properly without circular dependencies, and confirm module resolution follows configured paths. 3) **Strict Mode Compliance** - Validate all strict TypeScript rules pass without warnings, ensure no implicit any types remain in codebase, and verify null/undefined checks are properly handled. 4) **Development Workflow** - Test hot module replacement works correctly after fixes, verify IDE TypeScript integration shows no errors, and ensure debugging and source maps function properly in development mode. **SUCCESS CRITERIA: Development server must start successfully with `pnpm dev` before this task can be considered complete.**
