# Task ID: 23
# Title: Build Mobile-Optimized Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive mobile-first interface with modern responsive design, accessibility features, performance optimizations, and native-like capabilities for optimal contribution discovery on mobile devices
# Details:
Build a mobile-first responsive interface using advanced CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts. Implement touch-first design principles with comprehensive gesture support and haptic feedback. Add mobile-specific performance optimizations including lazy loading, service workers, and offline-first capabilities. Integrate native-like features using Web Share API, device sensors, and progressive enhancement. Ensure comprehensive accessibility with screen reader support and mobile-specific accessibility patterns. Implement mobile analytics and user behavior tracking for continuous optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Verify mobile-first responsive design across all devices, validate touch interactions and gestures work smoothly, test accessibility features with screen readers, confirm performance optimizations reduce load times, verify offline functionality works correctly, test native-like features and Web APIs, and validate analytics tracking captures mobile user behavior accurately
