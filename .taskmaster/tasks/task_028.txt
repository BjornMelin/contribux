# Task ID: 28
# Title: Create Comprehensive Integration Test Suite for GitHub API Client
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 27
# Priority: high
# Description: Build a comprehensive end-to-end integration test suite that validates real GitHub API interactions, webhook flows, rate limiting behavior, caching effectiveness, and token rotation under load conditions.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive integration test suite that complements existing unit tests by testing real GitHub API interactions in controlled environments. Create test scenarios for: 1) **Real API Integration Tests** - Set up test GitHub repositories and organizations, implement tests for REST and GraphQL API calls with actual network requests, validate cursor-based pagination with real data sets, and test GitHub Apps authentication with JWT token generation. 2) **Webhook Flow Testing** - Create webhook endpoint simulators, test webhook signature validation with real GitHub payloads, validate webhook processing pipelines, and test webhook retry mechanisms. 3) **Rate Limiting Validation** - Implement tests that intentionally trigger rate limits, validate exponential backoff and jitter behavior, test token rotation under rate limit conditions, and verify rate limit monitoring accuracy. 4) **Caching Effectiveness Tests** - Test ETag-based conditional requests with real GitHub responses, validate DataLoader cache behavior with N+1 query prevention, test cache invalidation strategies, and measure cache hit rates. 5) **Load Testing for Token Rotation** - Simulate high-concurrency scenarios with multiple tokens, test token refresh mechanisms under load, validate JWT generation performance, and test failover scenarios. 6) **Memory Leak Detection** - Integration with Task #27's cleanup methods, test memory usage patterns during extended operations, validate proper resource cleanup after test completion. Use tools like Jest with custom matchers, GitHub's REST and GraphQL APIs in test mode, Docker containers for isolated test environments, and performance monitoring tools for load testing. Implement proper test data cleanup and environment isolation to prevent test interference.

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive validation through: 1) **API Integration Verification** - Run tests against real GitHub API endpoints using test tokens, verify all CRUD operations work correctly, validate GraphQL query optimization stays under point limits, and confirm authentication flows complete successfully. 2) **Webhook Flow Validation** - Deploy test webhook endpoints, send real GitHub webhook payloads, verify signature validation passes/fails correctly, and confirm webhook processing handles all event types. 3) **Rate Limiting Behavior Tests** - Intentionally exceed rate limits and verify proper backoff behavior, test token rotation triggers at correct thresholds, validate rate limit headers are parsed correctly, and confirm API calls resume after rate limit reset. 4) **Caching Performance Tests** - Measure cache hit rates during repeated API calls, verify ETag headers reduce actual API requests, test DataLoader prevents N+1 queries in real scenarios, and validate cache invalidation works correctly. 5) **Load Testing Validation** - Run concurrent tests with multiple tokens, measure token rotation performance under load, verify no race conditions in token management, and confirm system stability during high-throughput scenarios. 6) **Memory and Resource Tests** - Monitor memory usage during extended test runs, verify cleanup methods from Task #27 prevent memory leaks, test resource cleanup after test completion, and validate no hanging connections or timers remain. Use GitHub's API rate limit headers to verify behavior, implement custom Jest matchers for API response validation, and create comprehensive test reports with performance metrics.
