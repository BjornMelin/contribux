# Task ID: 20
# Title: Build Repository Health Monitoring System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create system to continuously monitor and score repository health metrics
# Details:
Implement repository health monitoring that tracks maintainer response times, PR merge rates, issue close rates, and community activity. Create health score calculation algorithm with weighted factors. Add trending analysis to identify repositories gaining or losing momentum. Implement alerts for significant health changes. Store historical health data for trend analysis.

# Test Strategy:
Verify health metrics are calculated accurately, health scores reflect repository quality, trending analysis identifies changes correctly, and historical data is preserved

# Subtasks:
## 1. Metrics Tracking Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive system to collect, validate, and process various health metrics including vital signs, activity data, and custom health indicators with real-time data ingestion capabilities.
### Details:
Design and develop metric collection framework with support for multiple data sources (wearables, manual input, medical devices). Include data validation, normalization, and real-time processing pipelines. Implement metric categorization and metadata management.

## 2. Health Score Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Develop intelligent algorithm to calculate comprehensive health scores based on collected metrics, user profiles, and medical guidelines with weighted scoring and personalization features.
### Details:
Create multi-factor scoring algorithm incorporating various health metrics with appropriate weightings. Implement personalization based on age, gender, medical history, and goals. Include baseline establishment and score normalization across different user profiles.

## 3. Trending Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2
### Description: Build advanced analytics engine to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in health data over time using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques.
### Details:
Implement time-series analysis, pattern recognition, and trend detection algorithms. Include short-term and long-term trend analysis, seasonal pattern identification, and anomaly detection. Provide predictive insights and health trajectory forecasting.

## 4. Alert System [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2, 20.3
### Description: Design and implement intelligent alerting system with configurable thresholds, escalation rules, and multi-channel notification delivery for critical health events and trend deviations.
### Details:
Create rule-based and AI-driven alert engine with customizable thresholds and conditions. Implement multi-level alerting (info, warning, critical) with appropriate escalation paths. Include notification delivery via multiple channels (email, SMS, push notifications, in-app alerts).

## 5. Historical Data Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Implement robust data storage solution for long-term health data retention with efficient querying, data archiving, and compliance with healthcare data regulations.
### Details:
Design scalable database architecture for time-series health data with optimized storage and retrieval. Implement data lifecycle management, archiving strategies, and backup procedures. Ensure HIPAA compliance and data security measures for sensitive health information.
