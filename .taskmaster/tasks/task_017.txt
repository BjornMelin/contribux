# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Progressive Web App (PWA) Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive PWA capabilities with modern offline-first architecture, advanced service workers, enhanced push notifications, and native app-like experience using latest 2025 PWA standards
# Details:
Configure Next.js for advanced PWA with enhanced service worker featuring background sync, background fetch, and periodic sync. Implement modern push notifications with rich content and action buttons. Create comprehensive offline-first architecture with IndexedDB and smart synchronization. Add enhanced app manifest with shortcuts and categories. Implement smart app installation prompts with user behavior analysis. Include performance optimizations with resource preloading and critical resource prioritization. Add mobile-first features with device integration and native app-like interactions.

# Test Strategy:
Verify PWA installs with smart prompts, comprehensive offline functionality works across all features, push notifications deliver rich content with actions, background processing functions correctly, performance meets PWA standards, mobile experience is fully native-like, and offline-first architecture maintains data integrity
