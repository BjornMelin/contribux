# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Smart Scoring Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive scoring system that ranks opportunities based on multiple factors
# Details:
Build scoring engine that combines AI analysis scores with repository health metrics and user preferences. Implement weighted scoring algorithm: impact (30%), complexity inverse (20%), confidence (25%), urgency (25%). Add personalization based on user expertise and contribution history. Create score normalization and ranking logic. Store calculated scores in database with audit trail.

# Test Strategy:
Verify scoring algorithm produces consistent rankings, personalization affects scores appropriately, score normalization works correctly, and rankings match expected priority order

# Subtasks:
## 1. Weighted Algorithm Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core weighted scoring algorithm that applies configurable weights to different scoring criteria and calculates composite scores
### Details:
Implement mathematical algorithms for weighted scoring including weight validation, score calculation formulas, and handling of missing or invalid data points. Support multiple weighting schemes and dynamic weight adjustments.

## 2. Personalization Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Build personalization engine that adapts scoring based on user preferences, historical behavior, and contextual factors
### Details:
Create user profiling system, preference learning algorithms, behavioral pattern analysis, and contextual scoring adjustments. Implement machine learning models for personalized weight optimization.

## 3. Score Normalization System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement score normalization and standardization mechanisms to ensure consistent scoring across different scales and contexts
### Details:
Develop normalization algorithms including min-max scaling, z-score standardization, and percentile ranking. Handle outliers and ensure score consistency across different data distributions.

## 4. Ranking Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Create ranking system that orders items based on calculated scores with support for tie-breaking and custom ranking rules
### Details:
Implement ranking algorithms, tie-breaking strategies, pagination for large result sets, and custom ranking criteria. Support multiple ranking views and real-time rank updates.

## 5. Audit Trail Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Build comprehensive audit trail system to track scoring decisions, algorithm changes, and score history for transparency and debugging
### Details:
Design audit database schema, implement logging mechanisms for all scoring operations, create score history tracking, and build reporting tools for audit analysis and compliance.
