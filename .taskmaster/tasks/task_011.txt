# Task ID: 11
# Title: Create User Preferences Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build comprehensive user preference system for customizing opportunity discovery and notifications
# Details:
Implement user preferences management including expertise areas, programming languages, topics of interest, contribution types, notification settings, and scoring thresholds. Create preference validation using Zod schemas. Add preference learning from user behavior and feedback. Implement preference export/import functionality. Store preferences with versioning for analytics.

# Test Strategy:
Verify preferences are saved and retrieved correctly, validation prevents invalid data, preference learning improves recommendations, and export/import functionality works

# Subtasks:
## 1. Preference Schema Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design comprehensive schema for storing user preferences including data types, categories, hierarchical structures, and metadata fields
### Details:
Create database schema and data models for preference storage, define preference categories (UI, behavior, content, etc.), establish hierarchical preference structures, design metadata fields for tracking preference sources and timestamps, and define validation rules at schema level

## 2. Validation Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement robust validation system for preference data integrity, type checking, and constraint enforcement
### Details:
Build validation engine for preference data types and formats, implement constraint checking for valid preference values, create validation rules for preference combinations and conflicts, develop error handling and user feedback mechanisms, and establish data sanitization processes

## 3. Behavior Learning System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Develop machine learning system to automatically learn and adapt user preferences based on behavior patterns
### Details:
Implement behavior tracking and data collection mechanisms, develop ML algorithms for preference inference from user actions, create adaptive preference adjustment system, build confidence scoring for learned preferences, and establish feedback loops for continuous learning improvement

## 4. Export/Import Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Create comprehensive system for exporting and importing user preferences across different formats and platforms
### Details:
Develop export functionality for multiple formats (JSON, XML, CSV), implement import system with format detection and conversion, create data mapping and transformation utilities, build validation for imported preference data, and establish backup and restore capabilities

## 5. Versioning Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Implement versioning system for preference history tracking, rollback capabilities, and change management
### Details:
Design version control schema for preference changes, implement change tracking and audit logging, create rollback and restore functionality, develop preference diff and comparison tools, and establish archival and cleanup policies for version history
