# Task ID: 11
# Title: Create User Preferences Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build comprehensive user preference system for customizing opportunity discovery and notifications using React Server Components with Next.js 15, SWR v3 with native TanStack Query integration, AI-powered preference learning from user behavior, real-time WebSocket synchronization across devices, and enhanced GDPR compliance with encryption and audit trails
# Details:
Implement advanced user preferences management including expertise areas, programming languages, topics of interest, contribution types, notification settings, and AI-learned scoring thresholds. Create robust preference validation using Zod schemas with comprehensive type checking and constraint enforcement. Develop AI-powered machine learning system to automatically learn and adapt user preferences based on behavior patterns. Implement real-time preference synchronization across devices using WebSockets with conflict resolution. Add enhanced GDPR-compliant preference export/import functionality with encryption and comprehensive audit trails. Store preferences with sophisticated versioning system for analytics, rollback capabilities, and change management. Use React Server Components with Next.js 15 for efficient server-side rendering and SWR v3 with native TanStack Query integration for optimal data fetching, caching, and performance optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Verify preferences are saved and retrieved correctly with RSC and Next.js 15 rendering, Zod validation prevents invalid data with comprehensive type checking, AI preference learning improves recommendations based on behavior patterns, real-time WebSocket synchronization works across devices with conflict resolution, enhanced GDPR-compliant export/import functionality works with encryption and audit trails, sophisticated versioning and rollback capabilities function properly, and SWR v3 with native TanStack Query integration provides optimal caching and performance
