# Task ID: 4
# Title: Set up Authentication with GitHub OAuth
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement secure authentication system using GitHub OAuth for user login and token management
# Details:
Implement GitHub OAuth authentication using NextAuth.js or similar. Store encrypted GitHub tokens in database using Web Crypto API for encryption. Create user session management with JWT tokens (15-minute expiry with refresh). Implement middleware for protecting API routes. Add user profile creation and management. Ensure GDPR compliance for user data handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test complete OAuth flow, verify token encryption/decryption, validate session management, test protected route access, and ensure user data is properly stored and retrieved

# Subtasks:
## 1. OAuth App Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up OAuth applications with third-party providers (Google, GitHub, etc.) and configure client credentials, redirect URIs, and scopes
### Details:
Register applications with OAuth providers, obtain client IDs and secrets, configure authorized redirect URIs, set appropriate scopes for user data access, and store credentials securely in environment variables

## 2. NextAuth.js Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Install and configure NextAuth.js with OAuth providers, database adapters, and authentication callbacks
### Details:
Install NextAuth.js package, create API route handlers, configure OAuth providers with credentials from subtask 1, set up database adapter for session persistence, and implement custom callbacks for user data handling

## 3. Token Encryption [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement secure token encryption and decryption mechanisms for JWT tokens and refresh tokens
### Details:
Configure JWT encryption settings, implement custom JWT encode/decode functions, set up secure token storage, handle token rotation for refresh tokens, and ensure proper encryption key management

## 4. Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Configure session storage, expiration policies, and user session state management across the application
### Details:
Set up session storage strategy (database vs JWT), configure session expiration and renewal policies, implement session invalidation mechanisms, handle concurrent sessions, and manage user state persistence

## 5. Route Protection Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Create middleware to protect authenticated routes and implement role-based access control
### Details:
Develop Next.js middleware for route protection, implement authentication checks, create role-based access control logic, handle unauthorized access redirects, and protect API endpoints with proper authentication validation
