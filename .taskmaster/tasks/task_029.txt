# Title: Add Performance Benchmarks for GitHub API Client Critical Paths
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive performance benchmarking suite for GitHub API client critical paths including GraphQL query optimization, cache operations, token rotation under load, and rate limiting overhead to establish baseline metrics for production monitoring.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive performance benchmarking system to measure and monitor GitHub API client performance across critical paths identified in PR #7 review. Implement the following benchmark categories:

1) **GraphQL Query Optimization Performance** - Benchmark GraphQL query execution times with varying complexity levels (simple queries, complex nested queries, queries approaching 500,000 node limits). Measure query point consumption vs execution time correlation. Test cursor-based pagination performance with different page sizes. Benchmark query alias effectiveness and DataLoader N+1 prevention impact.

2) **Cache Operation Speeds** - Measure ETag-based conditional request cache hit/miss performance. Benchmark DataLoader cache effectiveness across different data patterns. Test multi-level caching performance under various load conditions. Measure cache memory usage and cleanup efficiency.

3) **Token Rotation Under Concurrent Load** - Benchmark JWT token generation and refresh performance under concurrent requests. Test GitHub Apps authentication flow performance with multiple simultaneous authentications. Measure token rotation impact on request latency during high-traffic scenarios.

4) **Rate Limiting Overhead** - Benchmark rate limit monitoring accuracy and performance impact. Measure retry logic with exponential backoff performance under rate limit conditions. Test rate limit prediction accuracy and preemptive throttling effectiveness.

5) **Baseline Metrics Collection** - Establish performance baselines for production monitoring using percentile-based metrics (P50, P95, P99). Create automated benchmark reporting with trend analysis. Implement performance regression detection with configurable thresholds.

Use performance testing tools like autocannon for load testing, clinic.js for Node.js performance profiling, and custom timing utilities for precise measurements. Create benchmark reports with visual charts and export capabilities for continuous monitoring integration.

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive performance validation through: 1) **Benchmark Accuracy Testing** - Verify all benchmark measurements are consistent across multiple runs with acceptable variance thresholds, validate timing precision and measurement overhead is minimal, confirm benchmark scenarios accurately represent real-world usage patterns. 2) **Load Testing Validation** - Run concurrent load tests to verify token rotation performance under stress, test cache performance degradation patterns under high load, validate rate limiting benchmarks reflect actual GitHub API behavior. 3) **Baseline Establishment** - Execute benchmark suite across different environments to establish reliable baselines, verify performance metrics collection accuracy and completeness, confirm regression detection thresholds are appropriately calibrated. 4) **Integration Testing** - Test benchmark integration with existing monitoring systems, verify automated reporting generates actionable insights, validate performance data export formats for production monitoring tools. 5) **Regression Testing** - Run benchmarks before and after code changes to detect performance regressions, verify benchmark suite can identify performance improvements and degradations accurately.
