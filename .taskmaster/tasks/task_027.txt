# Title: Add Memory Cleanup and Destroy Methods to GitHub API Client
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive memory cleanup and destroy methods for the GitHub API client to prevent memory leaks by clearing DataLoader caches, destroying cache managers, clearing timers, and closing open connections.
# Details:
Add a comprehensive cleanup system to the GitHub API client to address memory leaks identified in PR #7 review. Implement a `destroy()` method that performs the following cleanup operations: 1) Clear all DataLoader caches using `dataLoader.clearAll()` and set references to null, 2) Destroy cache managers by calling `cacheManager.reset()` and clearing all ETag-based conditional request caches, 3) Clear all active timers including retry timeouts, rate limit reset timers, and token refresh intervals using `clearTimeout()` and `clearInterval()`, 4) Close open HTTP connections by calling `agent.destroy()` on HTTP agents and aborting pending requests, 5) Clear token rotation system state and JWT generation timers, 6) Remove event listeners and webhook handlers to prevent memory retention, 7) Reset internal state variables and clear reference cycles. Implement proper error handling during cleanup to ensure partial failures don't prevent other cleanup operations. Add automatic cleanup on process exit using `process.on('exit')` and `process.on('SIGTERM')` handlers. Include memory usage monitoring to track cleanup effectiveness and add logging for debugging memory issues. Ensure the client can be safely recreated after destruction for testing scenarios.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive tests to verify memory cleanup effectiveness: 1) Test DataLoader cache clearing by populating caches, calling destroy(), and verifying all caches are empty, 2) Verify cache manager destruction by checking ETag caches are cleared and memory is released, 3) Test timer cleanup by creating various timers, calling destroy(), and ensuring no timers remain active using `process._getActiveHandles()`, 4) Verify HTTP connection closure by monitoring open sockets before and after cleanup, 5) Test token rotation cleanup by verifying JWT timers and refresh intervals are cleared, 6) Create memory leak tests using heap snapshots to measure memory usage before/after multiple create-destroy cycles, 7) Test error handling during cleanup by simulating failures in individual cleanup operations, 8) Verify automatic cleanup on process exit by testing signal handlers, 9) Test client recreation after destruction to ensure clean state, 10) Add performance tests to ensure cleanup completes within acceptable time limits (< 100ms), 11) Use memory profiling tools to validate no memory leaks persist after cleanup.
