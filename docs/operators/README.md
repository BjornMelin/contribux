## Best Practices

### Operational Guidelines

1. **Follow Documented Procedures**: Use established runbooks and procedures
2. **Test Before Production**: Always test changes in staging first
3. **Monitor Impact**: Watch metrics during and after changes
4. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of all operations
5. **Learn from Incidents**: Conduct post-mortems and improve procedures

### Safety Principles

1. **Fail Safe**: Design systems to fail in a safe state
2. **Gradual Changes**: Implement changes incrementally when possible
3. **Rollback Ready**: Always have a rollback plan before making changes
4. **Verify Success**: Confirm changes work as expected before completing
5. **Monitor Continuously**: Watch for issues after implementing changes
