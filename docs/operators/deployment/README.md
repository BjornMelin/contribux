## Deployment Overview

### Platform Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 deployed on Vercel
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with branch-based environments
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI Agents SDK integration
- **Monitoring**: Database performance monitoring and APM integration

### Environment Strategy

- **Production**: Main branch with strict security and performance settings
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for final testing
- **Development**: Feature development with relaxed constraints
- **Testing**: Automated CI/CD testing environment

### Deployment Types

#### 1. Standard Deployment

- Code changes without schema modifications
- Automatic deployment via Git hooks
- Zero-downtime deployment process

#### 2. Database Migration Deployment

- Schema changes requiring database migrations
- Branched testing before production application
- Rollback-safe migration procedures

#### 3. Configuration Deployment

- Infrastructure configuration changes
- Environment variable updates
- Security setting modifications

#### 4. Emergency Deployment

- Critical security fixes
- Production issue hotfixes
- Expedited deployment process

## Quick Start Deployment Commands

### Development Environment

```bash
# Setup development environment
npm run deploy:dev:setup

# Deploy to development
npm run deploy:dev

# Test development deployment
npm run deploy:dev:test
```

### Staging Environment

```bash
# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Run staging tests
npm run test:staging

# Validate staging deployment
npm run deploy:staging:validate
```

### Production Environment

```bash
# Pre-production checks
npm run deploy:prod:pre-check

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:prod

# Post-production validation
npm run deploy:prod:validate

# Production health check
npm run deploy:prod:health
```

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

### During Deployment

- [ ] Maintenance mode activated (if required)
- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] Application code deployed
- [ ] Configuration updates applied
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Maintenance mode deactivated

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Application functionality validated
- [ ] Database performance monitoring
- [ ] Error rate monitoring (< 0.1%)
- [ ] Response time monitoring (< 200ms p95)
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Environment Configuration

### Database Branch Mapping

```bash
# Production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user@prod-host/db-pooler

# Staging
DATABASE_URL_STAGING=postgresql://user@staging-host/db-pooler

# Development
DATABASE_URL_DEV=postgresql://user@dev-host/db-pooler

# Testing
DATABASE_URL_TEST=postgresql://user@test-host/db-pooler
```

### Environment Variables by Environment

## Deployment Security

### Access Control

- Production deployments require admin approval
- Staging deployments require developer approval
- Development deployments are self-service
- All deployments logged and audited

### Security Validations

- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code security analysis
- Configuration security validation
- Environment variable encryption verification

### Secrets Management

- Production secrets stored in secure vault
- Environment-specific secret rotation
- Automated secret validation during deployment
- Emergency secret rotation procedures

## Monitoring Integration

### Deployment Monitoring

- Real-time deployment status tracking
- Automated rollback on failure detection
- Performance impact monitoring
- Error rate spike detection

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Database performance tracking
- User experience monitoring
- Business metrics validation

## Support and Escalation

### Deployment Support

- **Level 1**: Automated deployment monitoring
- **Level 2**: DevOps team intervention
- **Level 3**: Platform architect involvement
- **Emergency**: 24/7 on-call response

### Escalation Procedures

1. **Monitor alerts**: Automated detection and initial response
2. **Team notification**: Development team notification
3. **Manager escalation**: Project manager involvement
4. **Executive escalation**: C-level notification for critical issues
