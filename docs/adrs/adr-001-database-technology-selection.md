**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Technical Lead, Backend Engineer  
**Tags**: database, performance, vector-search, ai

## Context and Problem Statement

contribux requires a database solution that can handle:

- Traditional relational data (users, repositories, opportunities)
- Vector embeddings for AI-powered semantic search
- High-performance queries for real-time opportunity matching
- Serverless architecture compatibility with automatic scaling
- Cost-effective operation for a bootstrapped startup

The system needs to support:

- Complex queries combining traditional and vector search

- Sub-millisecond cold starts
- Pay-per-use pricing model

**Cons**:

- Vendor lock-in to Neon platform
- Limited control over database configuration
- Potentially higher costs at massive scale
- Relatively new service (less battle-tested)

**Implementation Complexity**: Low
**Cost**: Low (generous free tier, usage-based pricing)

### Option 3: Supabase (PostgreSQL-as-a-Service)

**Description**: Managed PostgreSQL with built-in auth, real-time features, and vector support

**Pros**:

- Managed PostgreSQL with good performance
- Built-in authentication and real-time subscriptions
- Good documentation and developer tools
- Vector search capabilities
- Dashboard and admin interface

**Cons**:

- Additional features we don't need increase complexity
- Less flexible than pure PostgreSQL
- Pricing can be unpredictable
- Vendor lock-in considerations

**Implementation Complexity**: Medium
**Cost**: Medium

### Option 4: Pinecone + Traditional Database

**Description**: Dedicated vector database (Pinecone) combined with traditional relational database

**Pros**:

- Specialized vector search performance
- Dedicated vector database features
- Can pair with any relational database
- Highly optimized for similarity search

**Cons**:

- Additional complexity managing two databases
- Higher costs (two database services)
- Data synchronization challenges
- More complex application logic
- No ACID transactions across both systems

**Implementation Complexity**: High
**Cost**: High

### Option 5: Weaviate (Vector Database)

**Description**: Open-source vector database with GraphQL API and machine learning integration

**Pros**:

- Purpose-built for vector search and AI applications
- GraphQL API with good developer experience
- Built-in ML model integration
- Good documentation and community

**Cons**:

- Limited relational data capabilities
- Additional database for traditional data needed
- Smaller ecosystem compared to PostgreSQL
- More complex deployment and scaling

**Implementation Complexity**: High
**Cost**: Medium

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: **Neon PostgreSQL** because it provides the optimal balance of performance, developer experience, and operational simplicity for our serverless-first architecture.

### Rationale

1. **Serverless Architecture Alignment**: Neon's serverless model perfectly aligns with our Vercel deployment strategy and zero-maintenance philosophy.

2. **Vector Search Capabilities**: Native pgvector support provides excellent vector similarity search performance with the ability to combine vector and traditional queries in a single SQL statement.

3. **Developer Experience**: Exceptional TypeScript integration, database branching for development workflows, and minimal configuration required.

4. **Cost Efficiency**: Generous free tier and usage-based pricing model makes it ideal for our bootstrap phase while scaling costs predictably.

5. **Performance**: Sub-millisecond cold starts and automatic connection pooling ensure excellent performance in serverless environments.

6. **Future-Proofing**: Built on PostgreSQL 16 with access to the full PostgreSQL ecosystem and extensions.

### Consequences

#### Positive

- **Zero Infrastructure Management**: No database administration overhead
- **Excellent Developer Workflow**: Database branching enables safe testing and development
- **Cost Predictability**: Usage-based pricing with transparent billing
- **High Performance**: Optimized for serverless workloads with fast cold starts
- **SQL + Vector Search**: Unified query language for complex operations
- **Automatic Scaling**: Handles traffic spikes without manual intervention

#### Negative

- **Vendor Lock-in**: Dependent on Neon's continued service and pricing model
- **Limited Configuration**: Cannot fine-tune PostgreSQL settings
- **Newer Service**: Less battle-tested than traditional PostgreSQL deployments
- **Regional Limitations**: Data residency restricted to Neon's available regions

#### Neutral

- **PostgreSQL Compatibility**: Easy migration path to other PostgreSQL providers if needed
- **Standard Tooling**: Can use existing PostgreSQL tools and libraries
- **Learning Curve**: Team already familiar with PostgreSQL

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration (Week 1)

1. Create Neon account and provision database
2. Configure connection strings for dev/staging/production
3. Set up database schema with core tables
4. Implement database client configuration

### Phase 2: Vector Search Implementation (Week 2)

1. Enable pgvector extension
2. Create vector columns for embeddings
3. Implement HNSW indexes for performance
4. Build hybrid search functions combining SQL + vector queries

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3-4)

1. Implement database branching workflow for development
2. Set up monitoring and performance tracking
3. Configure backup and recovery procedures
4. Optimize queries based on performance metrics

### Success Criteria

- Query performance <100ms for p95 of opportunity search requests
- Successful vector similarity search with <500ms response times
- Zero database downtime during traffic spikes
- Development workflow using database branches
- Cost remains <$35/month for first 1000 users

### Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk**: Neon service outage or reliability issues
  - **Mitigation**: Implement database connection retry logic, monitor Neon status page, maintain export procedures for migration
- **Risk**: Unexpected cost increases at scale
  - **Mitigation**: Implement cost monitoring alerts, optimize queries proactively, plan for potential migration path
- **Risk**: Performance degradation with complex vector operations
  - **Mitigation**: Benchmark vector operations early, implement caching layer, optimize embedding dimensions

## Compliance and Standards

- **Security**: Connection encryption in transit, stored credentials in Vercel environment variables
- **Performance**: Target <100ms for p95 of database queries, sub-second vector search
- **Accessibility**: N/A for database technology choice
- **Privacy**: GDPR compliance through data deletion capabilities, minimal PII storage

## Validation and Testing

- **Proof of Concept**: Completed - Vector search with pgvector tested successfully
- **Testing Strategy**:
  - Unit tests for database functions
  - Integration tests for complex queries
  - Performance benchmarks for vector operations
  - Load testing with simulated user patterns
- **Rollback Plan**: Export data and migrate to self-hosted PostgreSQL if necessary
