## Context and Problem Statement

contribux requires an intelligent system to analyze GitHub repositories and opportunities for contribution viability. The system must:

- Analyze thousands of GitHub issues and repositories daily
- Provide consistent, high-quality assessments of contribution opportunities
- Scale efficiently while maintaining cost-effectiveness
- Support multiple AI models and providers for flexibility
- Enable continuous learning from user feedback and contribution outcomes

The AI system needs to handle:

- Repository health assessment and scoring
- Issue complexity analysis and skill requirement detection
- Contribution success probability estimation
- Personalized opportunity ranking based on user preferences
- Real-time processing of GitHub events and batch analysis

## Decision Drivers

- **Scalability**: Handle thousands of analysis requests daily
- **Cost Efficiency**: Minimize AI API costs while maintaining quality
- **Reliability**: Consistent performance with fallback mechanisms
- **Flexibility**: Support multiple AI providers and models

- Straightforward implementation

**Cons**:

- Limited scalability for complex workflows
- Single point of failure for all AI operations
- Difficulty optimizing for different task types
- Less flexibility for specialized processing
- Potential context window limitations

**Implementation Complexity**: Low
**Cost**: Low

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach with Specialized Models

**Description**: Combine multiple specialized models for different tasks without formal agent orchestration

**Pros**:

- Optimized models for specific tasks
- Cost efficiency through model selection
- Good performance for specialized tasks
- Easier to scale individual components
- Flexibility in model choices

**Cons**:

- Complex coordination logic to build
- No built-in workflow management
- Difficult to maintain consistency across models
- Manual retry and error handling required
- Limited observability across the system

**Implementation Complexity**: High
**Cost**: Medium

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: **OpenAI Agents SDK v1.0** because it provides the optimal balance of functionality, type safety, and operational simplicity for our AI-native architecture while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.

### Rationale

1. **TypeScript-First Development**: Native TypeScript support ensures type safety across our entire stack, from API to AI agents.

2. **Production Readiness**: Built-in guardrails, observability, and human-in-the-loop capabilities provide enterprise-grade reliability.

3. **Simplified Orchestration**: Handles complex agent coordination, handoffs, and state management automatically.

4. **Future Flexibility**: Provider abstraction allows integration with other AI providers as they become available.

5. **Observability**: Built-in tracing and debugging tools essential for monitoring AI performance in production.

6. **Developer Experience**: Reduces complexity of building custom orchestration while providing powerful agent capabilities.
