## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: **NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js) with GitHub Provider** because it provides the optimal balance of functionality, security, and developer experience while maintaining perfect compatibility with our Next.js serverless architecture.

### Rationale

1. **Next.js Native Integration**: Built specifically for Next.js with excellent App Router and edge function support.

2. **GitHub-First Design**: Seamless GitHub OAuth integration with built-in token management and refresh capabilities.

3. **Security by Default**: Industry-standard security practices, CSRF protection, and secure session management out of the box.

4. **Serverless Optimized**: Designed for serverless environments with efficient edge function compatibility.

5. **Zero Additional Infrastructure**: No external authentication service required, reducing costs and complexity.

6. **Developer Experience**: Excellent TypeScript support, comprehensive documentation, and active community.

7. **Flexible Session Management**: Supports both database and JWT sessions, allowing optimization for our use case.

### Authentication Flow Architecture

sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant App as Next.js App
    participant Auth as NextAuth.js
    participant GH as GitHub OAuth
    participant DB as Neon Database

    U->>App: Login Request
    App->>Auth: Initiate GitHub OAuth
    Auth->>GH: Redirect to GitHub
    GH->>U: Authorization Page
    U->>GH: Grant Permission
    GH->>Auth: Authorization Code
    Auth->>GH: Exchange for Access Token
    GH->>Auth: Access Token + Refresh Token
    Auth->>DB: Store User Session
    Auth->>App: Set Secure Cookies
    App->>U: Authenticated Session

    Note over U,DB: Subsequent API Requests
    U->>App: API Request
    App->>Auth: Validate Session
    Auth->>DB: Check Session Validity
    DB->>Auth: Session Data
    Auth->>App: User Information
