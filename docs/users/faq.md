## 🎯 Using the Platform

### Why am I not seeing any opportunities?

**Common reasons and solutions:**

1. **Incomplete Profile**
   - Add at least 3 programming languages
   - Set realistic experience levels
   - Include areas of interest

2. **Too Restrictive Preferences**
   - Broaden language selections
   - Include multiple difficulty levels
   - Expand contribution types

3. **Limited Repository Pool**
   - We focus on healthy, active repositories
   - Try including more mainstream technologies
   - Consider expanding beyond your comfort zone

4. **New Account**
   - Initial recommendations take 5-10 minutes to generate
   - Algorithm improves with usage
   - Provide feedback to improve matching

### How accurate are the difficulty ratings?

Our AI analyzes multiple factors to estimate difficulty:

**Accuracy Rates:**
- ⭐ **Good First Issues**: 90% accuracy for beginners

- 🟡 **Intermediate**: 80% suitable for 1-3 year experience
- 🔴 **Advanced**: 75% appropriate for 3+ years experience

**Factors Considered:**
- Lines of code typically changed
- Number of files involved
- Complexity of technology stack
- Reviewer feedback on similar issues
- Contributor experience patterns

### What does "98% compatibility" mean?

Compatibility scores indicate how well an opportunity matches your profile:

- **95-100%**: Perfect match for your skills and goals
- **80-94%**: Strong match, likely successful contribution
- **60-79%**: Good learning opportunity, some challenge
- **40-59%**: Stretch goal, requires significant learning
- **0-39%**: Poor match, likely too easy or difficult

**Factors in Compatibility:**
- Skill alignment (40%)
- Learning goal relevance (25%)
- Experience level appropriateness (20%)
- Time commitment fit (10%)
- Historical success patterns (5%)

### How do I improve my recommendations?

**Provide Better Profile Data:**

- Set specific, measurable learning goals
- Accurately rate your experience levels
- Include soft skills and interests

**Give Feedback:**
- Mark recommendations as helpful/not helpful
- Complete post-contribution surveys

- Rate completed contributions

**Stay Active:**
- Regular usage improves algorithm performance
