## Tips for Better Matches

### Be Specific and Honest

**Good:**

- "I know React basics and can work with existing components, but I'm still learning advanced patterns like custom hooks"

**Too Vague:**

- "I know React"

### Update Regularly

**Keep Current:**

- Skills you've learned in recent projects
- Technologies you're actively using at work
- New areas of interest you've discovered
- Changes in available time or schedule

### Balance Challenge and Comfort

**Ideal Balance:**

- 70% work within your comfort zone (build confidence)
- 30% stretch opportunities (encourage growth)

### Use Learning Mode

When starting with a new technology:

- Set it as "Learning" rather than "Proficient"
- Look for beginner-friendly issues in that technology
- Consider pair programming or mentorship opportunities

## Common Profile Mistakes

### Overestimating Skills

**Problem:** Rating yourself too highly leads to frustrating experiences

**Solution:** Be conservative in skill ratings; it's better to exceed expectations

### Underestimating Time Availability

**Problem:** Setting unrealistic time commitments leads to abandoned contributions

**Solution:** Track your actual contribution time for a few weeks, then adjust

### Too Narrow Focus

**Problem:** Very specific preferences limit opportunities

**Solution:** Start broad, then narrow down based on actual experience

### Ignoring Soft Skills

**Problem:** Focusing only on technical skills

**Solution:** Include interests in mentoring, documentation, community building
