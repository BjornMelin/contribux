## üèó Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19, TypeScript 5.8+
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.0+, Biome for formatting/linting
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector extension for vector search
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI Agents SDK, halfvec embeddings (1536 dimensions)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v5 with GitHub OAuth (simplified from WebAuthn)
- **Testing**: Vitest 3.2+ with V8 coverage provider, MSW 2.x for HTTP mocking
- **Package Manager**: pnpm 10.11.1 (strictly enforced)

### Key Principles

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - Prefer straightforward solutions over clever abstractions
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)** - Implement only what's explicitly needed
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Factor common logic into clear helpers
- **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests first, implement to make them pass
- **Zero-Trust Security** - Never trust, always verify

## üìà Current Status
