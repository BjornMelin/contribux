## üöÄ Quick Start

### For New Developers

1. Read the [Implementation Guide](./development/implementation-guide.md) to understand the architecture
2. Follow the [Authentication documentation](./features/authentication.md) to understand the OAuth system
3. Review the [Testing Infrastructure](./testing-infrastructure.md) for PGlite and Neon testing patterns
4. Check the [Solo Developer Guide](./development/solo-developer-guide.md) for maintenance workflows
5. Review the [Deployment Guide](./processes/deployment.md) for environment setup

### For Contributors

1. Review the [Pull Request Workflow](./processes/pull-request-workflow.md) for contribution guidelines
2. Understand the [API Documentation](./features/api-documentation.md) for integration work
3. Follow testing standards in [Testing Infrastructure](./testing-infrastructure.md)

### For Operators/DevOps

1. Follow the [Deployment Guide](./processes/deployment.md) for production deployment
2. Review [Memory Optimization](./development/memory-optimization.md) for performance monitoring
3. Check [Cleanup Reports](./reports/cleanup-reports.md) for current system status

## üèó Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19, TypeScript 5.8+
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.0+, Biome for formatting/linting
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector extension for vector search
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI Agents SDK, halfvec embeddings (1536 dimensions)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v5 with GitHub OAuth (simplified from WebAuthn)
- **Testing**: Vitest 3.2+ with V8 coverage provider, MSW 2.x for HTTP mocking
- **Package Manager**: pnpm 10.11.1 (strictly enforced)

### Key Principles

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - Prefer straightforward solutions over clever abstractions
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)** - Implement only what's explicitly needed
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Factor common logic into clear helpers
- **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests first, implement to make them pass
- **Zero-Trust Security** - Never trust, always verify

## üìà Current Status

### Test Coverage

- **Pass Rate**: 89.5% (598 passing, 70 failing out of 668 total tests)
- **Recent Improvement**: +4.4% pass rate increase (31 fewer failing tests)
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+ through meaningful tests, not line-targeting

### Key Achievements

- ‚úÖ **Core GitHub API Client** implemented with Octokit v5
- ‚úÖ **Authentication Simplified** to GitHub OAuth only (removed WebAuthn complexity)
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Test Infrastructure** with MSW 2.x and Vitest
- ‚úÖ **Memory Optimized** to 4.22 MB heap usage (excellent efficiency)
- ‚úÖ **Security Implementation** with zero-trust architecture
- ‚úÖ **Documentation Organized** into role-based structure

### Recent Changes

- **Documentation Consolidation**: Moved from scattered root files to organized structure
- **Import Fixes**: Resolved Lucide React compatibility issues
- **E2E Testing**: Comprehensive OAuth sign-in flow validation
- **Performance Optimization**: Bundle size reduction and memory monitoring
- **Test Reliability**: Improved from 85.1% to 89.5% pass rate
