## 2. EFFORT ESTIMATION FRAMEWORK

### Planning Poker Methodology (Fibonacci Scale)

Based on research into agile estimation techniques, using modified Fibonacci sequence:

```
Story Points Scale:
1 point   = 1-2 hours (trivial change)
2 points  = 2-4 hours (simple feature)
3 points  = 4-6 hours (moderate complexity)
5 points  = 1 day (complex feature)
8 points  = 1-2 days (very complex)
13 points = 2-3 days (epic-level task)
21 points = 3-5 days (major initiative)
```

### Three-Point Estimation for Critical Tasks

Using PERT-based estimation (Optimistic + 4Ã—Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6:

#### **Security Fixes Bundle**
- Optimistic: 6 hours
- Most Likely: 10 hours
- Pessimistic: 16 hours
- **PERT Estimate**: 10.7 hours (~1.5 days)

#### **Repository Discovery Scanner (Task 5)**
- Optimistic: 16 hours
- Most Likely: 24 hours
- Pessimistic: 40 hours
- **PERT Estimate**: 25.3 hours (~3 days)

- API latency: <500ms p95
- Repository scan: <10 seconds per repo
- Memory usage: <512MB per worker

---

## 9. CONTINGENCY PLANNING

### If Behind Schedule

#### Day 3 Checkpoint
**IF** security fixes not complete:
- Extend by 1 day maximum
- Reduce repository scanner scope
- Defer advanced classification

#### Day 5 Checkpoint
**IF** repository scanner incomplete:
- Deploy with manual data entry
- Reduce initial repository count
- Simplify classification algorithm

#### Day 7 Checkpoint
**IF** UI integration incomplete:
- Deploy API-only version
- Provide basic CLI interface
- Create simple results page

### Scope Reduction Options (Ordered)
1. Remove complex issue classification (save 3 points)
2. Simplify UI to table view (save 4 points)
3. Manual repository entry only (save 5 points)
4. Deploy security fixes only (save 21 points)

---

## 10. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. **Create Week 1 Sprint Board**: Transfer this plan to project management tool
2. **Security Audit**: Run OWASP ZAP scan to verify vulnerabilities
3. **Environment Setup**: Prepare Redis for rate limiting
4. **OpenAI Access**: Verify API keys and rate limits

### Communication Plan
- **Day 1**: Announce security sprint to stakeholders
- **Day 3**: Update on security completion, scanner start
- **Day 5**: Demo repository scanning capability
- **Day 7**: Deployment announcement with feature list

### Success Factors
1. **Scope Discipline**: Reject all Week 1 scope additions
2. **Security First**: No deployment with known vulnerabilities
3. **User Value Focus**: Minimum viable discovery must work
4. **Quality Gates**: Each day ends with working, tested code

---

## CONCLUSION

This Week 1 implementation roadmap provides a realistic path from 30.5% completion to a deployable MVP with core discovery functionality. The plan prioritizes **immediate security fixes** (addressing critical vulnerabilities) followed by **minimal viable AI discovery** (repository scanning) and **basic user interaction** (dashboard connection).

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Disciplined scope management (39 story points maximum)
- Security-first approach (no compromise on fixes)
- User value delivery (working discovery by Day 5)
- Continuous integration (daily deployable increments)

**Expected Outcome**: By end of Week 1, contribux will have secure authentication, basic repository discovery, and functional UI - sufficient for initial user testing while maintaining options for Week 2 AI enhancements.
