      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${env.GITHUB_TOKEN}` }
    });
    
    // Direct database connection (Neon supports edge)
    const dbResult = await env.DB.prepare('SELECT * FROM repositories WHERE...')
      .bind(searchTerm)
      .all();
    
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(dbResult));
  }
}
```

### 3. Progressive Web App Enhancement

**PWA Strategy for Reduced Server Load**:

Current PWA implementation is basic - enhance for maintenance reduction:

```typescript
// Advanced PWA caching strategy
const advancedCaching = {

  // API response caching with smart invalidation
  apiResponses: {
    repositories: "1 hour cache",
    userProfile: "24 hour cache",
    searchResults: "30 minute cache"
  },
  
  // Offline-first data synchronization
  offlineSync: {
    backgroundSync: true,
    conflictResolution: "last-write-wins"
  }
}
```
